.\m[cyan]SH NAME\m[white]
hsh \- simple command line shell interpreter

.SH \m[cyan]SYNOPSIS\m[white]
.B hsh

.SH \m[cyan]DESCRIPTION\m[white]
The
.B hsh
Program is a minimal Unix command-line shell interpreter developed as part of the Holberton School curriculum.

It operates in both interactive and non-interactive modes. In interactive mode, it displays a prompt and waits for user input. In non-interactive mode (e.g., when input is piped), it reads commands from standard input until EOF.

It supports:

.IP \[bu] 2
Execution of built-in commands such as \fBexit\fR and \fBenv\fR.
.IP \[bu]
Execution of external commands by searching directories listed in the \fBPATH\fR environment variable.
.IP \[bu]
Signal handling for \fBSIGINT\fR (Ctrl+C) to avoid shell termination.
.IP \[bu]
Error handling for memory allocation and invalid commands.

.SH \m[cyan]OPTIONS\m[white]
This shell currently does not accept any command-line options.

.SH \m[cyan]BUILTIN COMMANDS\m[white]
.TP
.B exit [n]
Exit the shell with a status of \fIn\fR. If \fIn\fR is omitted, the exit status is that of the last command executed.

.TP
.B env
Print the current environment variables to the standard output.

.SH \m[cyan]USAGE\m[white]
.PP
When launched:


- If standard input is a terminal, \fBhsh\fR runs in interactive mode, displays a prompt, and waits for input.

- If standard input is not a terminal, it reads and executes commands until EOF.

Each input line is tokenized and parsed:

- If the command matches a built-in, it is executed internally.

- Otherwise, the shell searches for the executable using the \fBPATH\fR variable.

- If the command is not found, an error message is displayed and exit code \fB127\fR is returned (in non-interactive mode).

.SH \m[cyan]EXAMPLES\m[white]
.TP
.B hsh
Launches the shell in interactive mode. Displays a prompt and waits for user input.

.TP
.B echo "ls -l" | hsh
Runs the shell in non-interactive mode and executes the command \fBls -l\fR.

.TP
.B hsh < script.sh
Reads commands from the file \fBscript.sh\fR and executes them sequentially.

.SH \m[cyan]EXIT STATUS\m[white]
.TP
0
Success.
.TP
127
Command not found.
.TP
Other
Return value of the last executed command or the status provided to \fBexit\fR.

.SH \m[cyan]SIGNALS\m[white]
.B hsh
handles \fBSIGINT\fR (Ctrl+C) gracefully by printing a new prompt on a new line instead of exiting. This allows uninterrupted use of the shell.

.SH \m[cyan]ERRORS\m[white]
If memory allocation fails, the shell prints an error message and exits with failure status.

If a command is not found, the shell prints:
.sp
\fBhsh: command: not found\fR
